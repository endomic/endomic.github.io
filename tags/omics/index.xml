      <description>&lt;p&gt;We exploit biological samples from the FHU PRECISE clinical-biological cohort comprising 500 scleroderma patients. Using a proteomic approach, we showed that the standardization of culture conditions and fibroblast stimulation was fundamental for the exploitation of the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using an integrative multi-omics analysis, we suggested that anti-nuclear antibodies could be a relevant tool for endotype definition. We recently explored the pathogenic effects of purified total IgG from SSc patients on crucial effector cells of fibrosis: fibroblasts (FB). Our results showed that purified IgG from SSc patients altered the phenotype of normal dermal FBs and their secreted material in a serotype-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;
